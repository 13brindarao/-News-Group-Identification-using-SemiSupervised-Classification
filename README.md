# -News-Group-Identification-using-SemiSupervised-Classification

**Motivation :** The process of extraction of large amounts of labeled text data for text classification is time-consuming and expensive operation, yet there is a vast number of unlabeled data sets available on the Internet that is simple and inexpensive.

**Problem Statement :** In the presence of large amount of unlabeled data and small amount of labelled data, would it be possible for the regular naïve bayes to take the advantage of large number of unlabeled data? Furthermore , we examine the effectiveness of employing semi-supervised learning Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm on Naïve bayes to get highly accurate text classification from a large amount of unlabeled data.

**Steps to run the model:**
 Download the zip file and extract all contents in one folder.
 Necessary python libraries are mentioned in the requirements.txt.
 Install all the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt file.
 Run the main.py file in python version >=3 ( preferably Spyder IDE )
 Once complete you can visualize all the model plots and also saved in the same folder.
